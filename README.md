# Solution of quantum books

In recent years, there have been many exciting advances in the quantum computer, and its quantum supremacy has already been demonstrated in some problems. Now is the best time to learn about quantum computers so that we can be prepared before it becomes the Next Big Thing and seize the opportunity. For beginners, I highly recommend the following two books, which are detailed and comprehensive.

1. [Quantum Computation and Quantum Information (QCQI) - Michael A. Nielsen & Isaac L. Chuang](./books/QCQI.pdf) (Newer, the best option)
2. [Quantum Information Theory (QIT) - MARK M. WILDE](./books/QIT.pdf)

This repository serves as a gathering of **unofficial** solutions to the exercises in the above two books. Since they are pretty important in this field, making sure the readers fully understand the exercises might be valuable. I also hope that researchers with the same research interests will work with me to improve this repository.
